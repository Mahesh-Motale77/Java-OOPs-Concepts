- It is a process of wrapping (binding and connecting) the attributes and behaviors of an 
  object together is known as Encapsulation.

Notes:
- We should not give direct access to the attributes of the class (object) to the user.
- But the user should be able to read or modify the attributes of a class (object) through
  behaviors.
- Therefore, it is good practice of a programmer to design a class such that, we have methods to 
  read the attributes as well as update the attributes.

Advantages:
Since we provide indirect access to the attributes it is secure and we have validation steps
before reading or updating the attributes.


*** Data Hiding ***   Encapsulation process is used to achieve data hiding.

Data Hiding is the process of restricting direct access to the attributes of a class (object) and
Providing secured and indirect acccess to the properties of a class (object) is known as Data Hiding.


*** How do achieve Data Hiding ***
We can achieve data hiding by following the following steps:
1. Make attributes private.
2. Design getter() and setter() methods for reading and updating the attributes respectively.
3. This helps the programmer to get flexibility to design the following:
    -- We can make an attributes only readable but not modifiable.
    -- We can make an attribute only modifiable but not readable.
    -- We can make an attribute both readable and modifiable.
    -- We can make an attribute neither readable nor modifiable.
