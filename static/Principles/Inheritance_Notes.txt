***********************  IS-A Relationship  ***************************

- The Relationship between two or more object which is similar to parent and child Relation
  is known as IS-A Relationship.
- The IS-A Relationship the child object aquires all the properties and behavior of parent 
  object along with it's own attributes and behavior.

- With the help of IS-A Relationship we can achieve Generalization and Specialization.

- Here the parent class is known as generalize and child class is known as Specialized..
- With the help of child class object reference we can use all the members of parent class
  as well as child class.
- With the help of parent class object reference, we can use only the members of parent class,
  but not child class members.

  *** Terminology: 
  Parent class == Super Class == base class
  Child class == Subclass == derived class


--------- We can achieve IS-A Relationship with the help of Inheritance.


************************* Inheritance *****************************************

-- It is a process of one class acquiring all the properties and behavior from another class, is known as Inheritance.

In java we can achieve Inheritance using--
    1) extends keyword
    2) implements keyword


**** Levels of Inheritance :
    1) Single level Inheritance
    2) Multi level Inheritance
    3) Hierarchical Inheritance
    4) Multiple Inheritance
    5) Hybrid Inheritance
