- Association between two or more objects is known as Relationship.

- Relationship are categories into 2 type 
    --- 1) has-A relationship
    --- 2) IS-A relationship

*** HAS-A Relationship:
It is a association between two or more objects where one object is dependent on another object.

Based on the level of dependancy HAS-A relationship is further categories into 2 types:
----- 1. Composition: It is assocation between two or more objects, where one object can not exist without another object.  
        e.g. Battery & Mobile

----- 2. Aggregation: It is association between two or more objects, there is dependency but one can exist without another.
        e.g. Pendrive & Computer


Que. How to achieve HAS-A relationship ?
We can achieve HAS-A relationship as follows
1. An object must have reference of another object
2. We can easily achieve this design by creating reference variable of one object inside another object.


We can achieve HAS-A relationship using:
---- 1) Early Binding / Early instantiation
---- 2) Lazy Binding  / Lazy instantiation
