            *** Object ***

- Object is a block of memory, which is created at runtime in heap area which is representation
  real world entity.
  
NOTE:
- To create any object or before creating an object in real world, a design or blue print
  is created. It provides all the specification of an object.

Ex. 
- Before manufacturing a car, a blue print of car is created.
- Similarly in java before creating an object, the blue print must be created, which contain all the specification of that Object.
  This design is done with the help of class...
